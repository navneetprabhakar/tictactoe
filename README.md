# tictactoe with AI Player
This repository is implementation of the game tic-tac-toe with a computer player for 3x3 player. The computer player calculates all possible moves on the board, due to this it either wins or pushes for a draw. I used minimax algorithm for this with a small optimisation with Dynamic programming.
